What if, just if, the truth of the world does not exist.

Take a simple example, that we all know everybody has blind spots no matter how good vision one may have, but what do we feel and think when it happens? Most of the time, we feel nothing and know nothing about it as if the world is exactly as what we see. Then, why? Why we are not aware of the existence of the blind spots of ourselves but intuitively and constantly believing what we see is the truth? Further, how can we be so sure there must be a truth for everything?

Physically, and objectively, the answer should be yes and no. Since it depends on whether you observe it and how you observe it. In a fashionale manner, it is dependent of observation, like the quantum mechanics. That contradicts with the definition of truth. Therefore, if something can not be proven to be existing, it should be considered as not exist. At least, this is in line with the spirit of truth.
