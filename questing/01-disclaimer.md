What if, just if, the truth of the world does not exist.

Take a simple example, that we all know everybody has blind spots no matter how good vision one may have, but what do we feel and think when it happens? Most of the time, we feel nothing and know nothing about it as if the world is exactly as what we see. Then, why? Why are we not aware of the existence of the blind spots of ourselves but intuitively and constantly believing what we see is the truth? With this question in mind, another question is, what is it if a truth comes with blind spots?

I'm not going to discuss about the truth. Everybody may have his or her own unique belief about the truth, and there is no correct or incorrect ones since they are out of human capability to prove. What I'm trying to say at the very beginning is, as a normal person, I don't think I have the capability to say what is the truth or not, neither can I say which is or is not closer to the truth among multiple things. Equally, if you are also a normal person, please understand I'm not going to argue anything about the truth with you. For example, I might say AI is bullshit or blockchain is bullshit. This does NOT necessarily mean I'm stating a truth but rather feelings from my own point of view within certain limited scope. Equally, it is absolutely fine if my words been regarded as bullshit from your point of view, at least it is not my problem of wasting time on bullshits. Hence, those feelings do not conflict with the statements from many others saying AI or blockchain is the future. A bullshit future can still be a future, and somehow that's why we all got things to do, to either make the world better, or worse. 

Anyway, I do guarantee something out of my work except for "the truth":
1. I guarantee I'll try to say what I believe to be true, so far with what I know.
2. I guarantee I'll keep working to find out what is true or not, no matter if it is possible or not.


Last but not least, if you do spend time on my articles, I'll appreciate your time no matter what you think.

Have a good day!
