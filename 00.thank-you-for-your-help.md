# Thank you for your help

What is the most appropriate, most accurate, and most true words to say at the end of this life, or at the end of any kinds of relationships, or at any moment to anybody?
For me, I shall say -- thank you for your help --
thank you for your help in building up me, this unique personality, in a particular way at a specific time. 

It is natural to be grateful for a supportive help. From the very beginning that we learn walking, eating, and speaking in our childhood, to the point that we could make some noise in the world by doing something, there must be countless moments that we would never have gotten through without some sort of help. 
For me, things like, went to college, went to the graduate school, got some meaningful or important things done at work or in the life, are all under the help of others without which nothing I could achieve.

However, it is not natural to identify such a supportive help. 
"Beauty is everywhere. It is not that she is lacking to our eye, but our eyes which fail to perceive her." -- Auguste Rodin. 
So is the supportive help that should be appreciated.
True Christians learn this by praising the creator for everything; True Buddhists learn this by emptying themselves at any moment. 
How did a nobody like me learn this lesson? People say, "You never know what you have until you lose it", so did I. 
After struggling in a mediocre but really challenging life for decades, when I was walking beside Gang Rinpoche at an altitude of 5651 meters with only half of normal Oxygen supply in the air, I finally acknowledged it is everything even including the most common and invisible air should be appreciated.

What about those who made us suffering a lot? 
Other than the basic logic that pain is a sensory experience instead of an objective fact, 
even for those who happened to be my enemies intentionally or unintentionally, 
I also would like to say thank you for your help with no reluctance. 

Why? One does not have to be a Buddhist or a Christian that he or she probably had heard some of those wisdom here or there. 
Like, in Buddhism, it says "Troubles are Bodhi"; 
In the Gospel, Jesus says, "love your enemies and pray for those who persecute you", and "if anyone slaps you on the right cheek, turn to him the other also". 
If spoken in my words, it would be like, thank you for providing the very authentic opportunities for me to know and understand the complexities of the real world, and in turn, to practice and grow my patiences on everything at anywhere and anytime;
Moreover, I shall cherish the opportunity and try to experience more and practice batter from you by providing my other side cheek for you to slap also.

Once upon a time in my previous work, there were a few influential people who not only could not understand but also could not tolerate my experience, logic, idea, or my words, or even my behavior like a smile or even a breath. I could never understand if it was not them, that even for good people, say, good husbands and good fathers at home, good friends or good partners for someone else, they could turn their dark sides to me, with or without reasons. From which I learned that bad thing happens but does not have to be a fault of any person. As Jesus says, I'll pray for them for all their goodnesses.

In all, thank you for your help on the things that have been done and those yet to be done, with the most intact respect from my deepest inside.
